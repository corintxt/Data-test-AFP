Migration data portal says:

Considerable displacement events caused by the 2020 hurricane season (historically one of the most active registered in the Atlantic) added to the changes witnessed in 2020 as result of the pandemic. Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua in particular were deeply impacted by Hurricanes Eta and Iota in November 2020, and the pandemic has complicated the disaster response in the region (Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC), 2021).
Also the Covid pandemic led to some changes in migration.
